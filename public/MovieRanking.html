<h3>KGF 2</h3>

<p>After Allu Arjun's Pushpa and SS Rajamouli's RRR, it's now time for Yash's KGF: Chapter 2 to set your screens on fire.
    Quite literally. The first part, KGF: Chapter 1, ended on a high note and managed to keep curiosity alive for over 3.5 years.
    With KGF: Chapter 2's release today (April 14), Yash and director Prashanth Neel have hit it out of the park once again.
</p>
<p>Raja Krishnappa Bairya AKA Rocky Bhai (Yash) is now the ruler of Kolar Gold Fields (KGF) after killing Garuda. In Prakash Raj's 
    words, Rocky has built an indestructible empire in KGF with his clever thinking and quick wit. As he plans to extend his empire, 
    his enemies take the help of the mighty Adheera (Sanjay Dutt) to finish him. From here, it becomes a battle of machismo. Meanwhile,
    Prime Minister Ramika Sen (Raveena Tandon) fears the meteoric rise of Rocky Bhai. How do they tackle Rocky forms the story.

<h3>BAHUBALI 2</h3>
<p>This part is more prequel than sequel because initially the story traces the origins of Baahubali’s father, who was originally meant
    to be the King of Mahishmati. It also delves on the love-story between Amarendra and Devasena(Anushka Shetty), who is mother of 
    Mahendra Baahubali(Prabhas in a dual role.) Recounted in the folklore-meets-Aesop’s fable-style, the plot is simple and carries the 
    good triumphs over evil thought forward just like the first part did. Albeit with some childish conspiracy theories added in. 
    Of course, the end comes together in a long-drawn climax that could have been 10-minutes shorter.
</p>
<p>Part 2-The Conclusion onerously carries the equity of the first part on its shoulder and ups the scale on many counts—especially in 
    heroism. Baahubali has been sketched out as such a symbol of strength and power that he makes you root for him throughout. Prabhas 
    is terrific as father and son. What’s more, this part provides an answer to a question uppermost in everyone’s mind for the last two 
    years—it tells you why Katappa, the old faithful, killed Baahubali Senior.
</p>
<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>It’s not long in “RRR” before a tiger and a wolf collide midair during a brawl with one of the film’s two musclebound heroes. Scenes 
    of glorious excess make the screen hum with energy in the latest feature from S.S. Rajamouli, the director of the “Baahubali” blockbusters.
</p>
<p>Set in 1920s India before independence, “RRR” pairs two of the country’s biggest stars, N.T. Rama Rao Jr. (known as “Jr. NTR”) and Ram 
    Charan, as superfriends from either side of a bloody colonial divide. A goofily gallant Jr. NTR plays Bheem, a warrior from the Gond 
    tribe, while Charan smolders as Ram, a fearsome police officer who is underestimated by his white superiors. (The characters are 
    inspired by two rebel heroes from the era, Komaram Bheem and Alluri Sitarama Raju.)
</p>
<p>Bheem journeys to Delhi to rescue a Gond girl enslaved by the British governor and his wife, a couple of sadists. Ram has orders to identify 
    and capture Bheem by going undercover with revolutionaries. Instead, the men unwittingly make fast friends when they save a child stranded 
    on a river that’s on fire. (As one does.)
